# tryout-board-4IAR

codes for 4iar with tryout board.

Have several versions of it, but didn't decide what version to use.

The latest discussion on what version to use:

* Current versions just open tryout board whenever participants want.
* (Dongjae) My personal experience with these versions of 4iar is that I don't need this tryout board in general. Of course I lost many times, but lost because I didnt realize what's coming (what I overlooked).
* (Dongjae) So I think we need N-alternative forced choice version of it which requires very deep search (planning) to know the answer. You can easily manipulate required planning depth with multiple confusing options (entropy of future states
 rewards or something like that)
